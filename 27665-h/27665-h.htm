<p class="cap">"What would you think," I asked
Marjorie over supper, "if I should undertake
to lead a junior achievement
group this summer?"</p>

<p>She pondered it while she went to
the kitchen to bring in the dessert.
It was dried apricot pie, and very
tasty, I might add.</p>

<p>"Why, Donald," she said, "it could
be quite interesting, if I understand
what a junior achievement group is.
What gave you the idea?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't my idea, really," I admitted.
"Mr. McCormack called me
to the office today, and told me that
some of the children in the lower
grades wanted to start one. They
need adult guidance of course, and
one of the group suggested my name."</p>

<p>I should explain, perhaps, that I
teach a course in general science in
our Ridgeville Junior High School,
and another in general physics in the
Senior High School. It's a privilege
which I'm sure many educators must
envy, teaching in Ridgeville, for our
new school is a fine one, and our
academic standards are high. On the
other hand, the fathers of most of
my students work for the Commission
and a constant awareness of the Commission
and its work pervades the
town. It is an uneasy privilege then,
at least sometimes, to teach my old-fashioned
brand of science to these
children of a new age.</p>

<p>"That's very nice," said Marjorie.
"What does a junior achievement
group do?"</p>

<p>"It has the purpose," I told her,
"of teaching the members something
about commerce and industry. They
manufacture simple compositions
like polishing waxes and sell them
from door-to-door. Some groups have
built up tidy little bank accounts
which are available for later educational
expenses."</p>

<p>"Gracious, you wouldn't have to
sell from door-to-door, would you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I'd just tell the
kids how to do it."</p>

<p>Marjorie put back her head and
laughed, and I was forced to join her,
for we both recognize that my understanding
and "feel" for commercial
matters&mdash;if I may use that expression&mdash;is
almost nonexistent.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," I said, "laugh at
my commercial aspirations. But don't
worry about it, really. Mr. McCormack
said we could get Mr. Wells from
Commercial Department to help out
if he was needed. There is one problem,
though. Mr. McCormack is going
to put up fifty dollars to buy any
raw materials wanted and he rather
suggested that I might advance another
fifty. The question is, could we
do it?"</p>

<p>Marjorie did mental arithmetic.
"Yes," she said, "yes, if it's something
you'd like to do."</p>

<p>We've had to watch such things
rather closely for the last ten&mdash;no,
eleven years. Back in the old Ridgeville,
fifty-odd miles to the south, we
had our home almost paid for, when
the accident occurred. It was in the
path of the heaviest fallout, and we
couldn't have kept on living there
even if the town had stayed. When
Ridgeville moved to its present site,
so, of course, did we, which meant
starting mortgage payments all over
again.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">Thus it was that on a Wednesday
morning about three weeks later, I
was sitting at one end of a plank picnic
table with five boys and girls
lined up along the sides. This was to
be our headquarters and factory for
the summer&mdash;a roomy unused barn
belonging to the parents of one of
the group members, Tommy Miller.</p>

<p>"O.K.," I said, "let's relax. You
don't need to treat me as a teacher,
you know. I stopped being a school
teacher when the final grades went in
last Friday. I'm on vacation now. My
job here is only to advise, and I'm
going to do that as little as possible.
You're going to decide what to do,
and if it's safe and legal and possible
to do with the starting capital we
have, I'll go along with it and help
in any way I can. This is your meeting."</p>

<p>Mr. McCormack had told me, and
in some detail, about the youngsters
I'd be dealing with. The three who
were sitting to my left were the ones
who had proposed the group in the
first place.</p>

<p>Doris Enright was a grave young
lady of ten years, who might, I
thought, be quite a beauty in a few
more years, but was at the moment
rather angular&mdash;all shoulders and elbows.
Peter Cope, Jr. and Hilary Matlack
were skinny kids, too. The three
were of an age and were all tall for
ten-year-olds.</p>

<p>I had the impression during that
first meeting that they looked rather
alike, but this wasn't so. Their features
were quite different. Perhaps
from association, for they were close
friends, they had just come to have
a certain similarity of restrained gesture
and of modulated voice. And
they were all tanned by sun and wind
to a degree that made their eyes seem
light and their teeth startlingly white.</p>

<p>The two on my right were cast in
a different mold. Mary McCready
was a big husky redhead of twelve,
with a face full of freckles and an
infectious laugh, and Tommy Miller,
a few months younger, was just an
average, extroverted, well adjusted
youngster, noisy and restless, tee-shirted
and butch-barbered.</p>

<p>The group exchanged looks to see
who would lead off, and Peter Cope
seemed to be elected.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Henderson, a junior
achievement group is a bunch of kids
who get together to manufacture and
sell things, and maybe make some
money."</p>

<p>"Is that what you want to do," I
asked, "make money?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" Tommy asked.
"There's something wrong with making
money?"</p>

<p>"Well, sure, I suppose we want to,"
said Hilary. "We'll need some money
to do the things we want to do later."</p>

<p>"And what sort of things would
you like to make and sell?" I asked.</p>

<p>The usual products, of course, with
these junior achievement efforts, are
chemical specialties that can be made
safely and that people will buy and
use without misgivings&mdash;solvent to
free up rusty bolts, cleaner to remove
road tar, mechanic's hand soap&mdash;that
sort of thing. Mr. McCormack had
told me, though, that I might find
these youngsters a bit more ambitious.
"The Miller boy and Mary McCready,"
he had said, "have exceptionally
high IQ's&mdash;around one forty
or one fifty. The other three are hard
to classify. They have some of the
attributes of exceptional pupils, but
much of the time they seem to have
little interest in their studies. The
junior achievement idea has sparked
their imaginations. Maybe it'll be just
what they need."</p>

<p>Mary said, "Why don't we make a
freckle remover? I'd be our first customer."</p>

<hr />

<p>"The thing to do," Tommy offered,
"is to figure out what people in
Ridgeville want to buy, then sell it
to them."</p>

<p>"I'd like to make something by
powder metallurgy techniques," said
Pete. He fixed me with a challenging
eye. "You should be able to make
ball bearings by molding, then densify
them by electroplating."</p>

<p>"And all we'd need is a hydraulic
press," I told him, "which, on a guess,
might cost ten thousand dollars. Let's
think of something easier."</p>

<p>Pete mulled it over and nodded
reluctantly. "Then maybe something
in the electronics field. A hi-fi sub-assembly
of some kind."</p>

<p>"How about a new detergent?" Hilary
put in.</p>

<p>"Like the liquid dishwashing detergents?"
I asked.</p>

<p>He was scornful. "No, they're formulations&mdash;you
know, mixtures.
That's cookbook chemistry. I mean a
brand new synthetic detergent. I've
got an idea for one that ought to be
good even in the hard water we've
got around here."</p>

<p>"Well, now," I said, "organic synthesis
sounds like another operation
calling for capital investment. If we
should keep the achievement group
going for several summers, it might
be possible later on to carry out a
safe synthesis of some sort. You're
Dr. Matlack's son, aren't you? Been
dipping into your father's library?"</p>

<p>"Some," said Hilary, "and I've got
a home laboratory."</p>

<p>"How about you, Doris?" I prompted.
"Do you have a special field of interest?"</p>

<p>"No." She shook her head in mock
despondency. "I'm not very technical.
Just sort of miscellaneous. But if the
group wanted to raise some mice, I'd
be willing to turn over a project I've
had going at home."</p>

<p>"You could sell mice?" Tommy demanded
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Mice," I echoed, then sat back and
thought about it. "Are they a pure
strain? One of the recognized laboratory
strains? Healthy mice of the
right strain," I explained to Tommy,
"might be sold to laboratories. I have
an idea the Commission buys a supply
every month."</p>

<p>"No," said Doris, "these aren't laboratory
mice. They're fancy ones. I
got the first four pairs from a pet
shop in Denver, but they're red&mdash;sort
of chipmunk color, you know. I've
carried them through seventeen generations
of careful selection."</p>

<p>"Well, now," I admitted, "the market
for red mice might be rather limited.
Why don't you consider making
an after-shave lotion? Denatured alcohol,
glycerine, water, a little color
and perfume. You could buy some
bottles and have some labels printed.
You'd be in business before you
knew it."</p>

<p>There was a pause, then Tommy
inquired, "How do you sell it?"</p>

<p>"Door-to-door."</p>

<p>He made a face. "Never build up
any volume. Unless it did something
extra. You say we'd put color in it.
How about enough color to leave
your face looking tanned. Men won't
use cosmetics and junk, but if they
didn't have to admit it, they might
like the shave lotion."</p>

<p>Hilary had been deep in thought.
He said suddenly, "Gosh, I think I
know how to make a&mdash;what do you
want to call it&mdash;a before-shave lotion."</p>

<p>"What would that be?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You'd use it before you shaved."</p>

<p>"I suppose there might be people
who'd prefer to use it beforehand,"
I conceded.</p>

<p>"There will be people," he said
darkly, and subsided.</p>

<p>Mrs. Miller came out to the barn
after a while, bringing a bucket of
soft drinks and ice, a couple of loaves
of bread and ingredients for a variety
of sandwiches. The parents had
agreed to underwrite lunches at the
barn and Betty Miller philosophically
assumed the role of commissary
officer. She paused only to say hello
and to ask how we were progressing
with our organization meeting.</p>

<p>I'd forgotten all about organization,
and that, according to all the
articles I had perused, is most important
to such groups. It's standard practice
for every member of the group
to be a company officer. Of course a
young boy who doesn't know any better,
may wind up a sales manager.</p>

<p>Over the sandwiches, then, I suggested
nominating company officers,
but they seemed not to be interested.
Peter Cope waved it off by remarking
that they'd each do what came
naturally. On the other hand, they
pondered at some length about a
name for the organization, without
reaching any conclusions, so we returned
to the problem of what to
make.</p>

<p>It was Mary, finally, who advanced
the thought of kites. At first there
was little enthusiasm, then Peter said,
"You know, we could work up something
new. Has anybody ever seen a
kite made like a wind sock?"</p>

<p>Nobody had. Pete drew figures in
the air with his hands. "How about
the hole at the small end?"</p>

<p>"I'll make one tonight," said Doris,
"and think about the small end.
It'll work out all right."</p>

<p>I wished that the youngsters weren't
starting out by inventing a new
article to manufacture, and risking an
almost certain disappointment, but to
hold my guidance to the minimum, I
said nothing, knowing that later I
could help them redesign it along
standard lines.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap">At supper I reviewed the day's
happenings with Marjorie and tried
to recall all of the ideas which had
been propounded. Most of them were
impractical, of course, for a group of
children to attempt, but several of
them appeared quite attractive.</p>

<p>Tommy, for example, wanted to
put tooth powder into tablets that
one would chew before brushing the
teeth. He thought there should be
two colors in the same bottle&mdash;orange
for morning and blue for night,
the blue ones designed to leave the
mouth alkaline at bed time.</p>

<p>Pete wanted to make a combination
nail and wood screw. You'd
drive it in with a hammer up to the
threaded part, then send it home with
a few turns of a screwdriver.</p>

<p>Hilary, reluctantly forsaking his
ideas on detergents, suggested we
make black plastic discs, like poker
chips but thinner and as cheap as
possible, to scatter on a snowy sidewalk
where they would pick up extra
heat from the sun and melt the
snow more rapidly. Afterward one
would sweep up and collect the discs.</p>

<p>Doris added to this that if you
could make the discs light enough to
float, they might be colored white
and spread on the surface of a reservoir
to reduce evaporation.</p>

<p>These latter ideas had made unknowing
use of some basic physics,
and I'm afraid I relapsed for a few
minutes into the role of teacher and
told them a little bit about the laws
of radiation and absorption of heat.</p>

<p>"My," said Marjorie, "they're really
smart boys and girls. Tommy Miller
does sound like a born salesman.
Somehow I don't think you're going
to have to call in Mr. Wells."</p>

<p>I do feel just a little embarrassed
about the kite, even now. The fact
that it flew surprised me. That it flew
so confoundedly well was humiliating.
Four of them were at the barn
when I arrived next morning; or
rather on the rise of ground just beyond
it, and the kite hung motionless
and almost out of sight in the pale
sky. I stood and watched for a moment,
then they saw me.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Henderson," Mary said,
and proffered the cord which was
wound on a fishing reel. I played the
kite up and down for a few minutes,
then reeled it in. It was, almost exactly,
a wind sock, but the hole at the
small end was shaped&mdash;by wire&mdash;into
the general form of a kidney bean.
It was beautifully made, and had a
sort of professional look about it.</p>

<p>"It flies too well," Mary told Doris.
"A kite ought to get caught in a tree
sometimes."</p>

<p>"You're right," Doris agreed. "Let's
see it." She gave the wire at the small
end the slightest of twists. "There, it
ought to swoop."</p>

<p>Sure enough, in the moderate
breeze of that morning, the kite
swooped and yawed to Mary's entire
satisfaction. As we trailed back to the
barn I asked Doris, "How did you
know that flattening the lower edge
of the hole would create instability?"
She looked doubtful.</p>

<p>"Why it would have to, wouldn't
it? It changed the pattern of air pressures."
She glanced at me quickly.
"Of course, I tried a lot of different
shapes while I was making it."</p>

<p>"Naturally," I said, and let it go at
that. "Where's Tommy?"</p>

<p>"He stopped off at the bank," Pete
Cope told me, "to borrow some money.
We'll want to buy materials to
make some of these kites."</p>

<p>"But I said yesterday that Mr. McCormack
and I were going to advance
some cash to get started."</p>

<p>"Oh, sure, but don't you think it
would be better to borrow from a
bank? More businesslike?"</p>

<p>"Doubtless," I said, "but banks generally
want some security." I would
have gone on and explained matters
further, except that Tommy walked
in and handed me a pocket check
book.</p>

<p>"I got two hundred and fifty," he
volunteered&mdash;not without a hint of
complacency in his voice. "It didn't
take long, but they sure made it out
a big deal. Half the guys in the bank
had to be called in to listen to the
proposition. The account's in your
name, Mr. Henderson, and you'll have
to make out the checks. And they
want you to stop in at the bank and
give them a specimen signature. Oh,
yes, and cosign the note."</p>

<p>My heart sank. I'd never had any
dealings with banks except in the
matter of mortgages, and bank people
make me most uneasy. To say
nothing of finding myself responsible
for a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar
note&mdash;over two weeks salary. I made
a mental vow to sign very few checks.</p>

<p>"So then I stopped by at Apex
Stationers," Tommy went on, "and ordered
some paper and envelopes. We
hadn't picked a name yesterday, but I
figured what's to lose, and picked one.
Ridge Industries, how's that?" Everybody
nodded.</p>

<p>"Just three lines on the letterhead,"
he explained. "Ridge Industries&mdash;Ridgeville&mdash;Montana."</p>

<p>I got my voice back and said, "Engraved,
I trust."</p>

<p>"Well, sure," he replied. "You can't
afford to look chintzy."</p>

<hr />

<p>My appetite was not at its best
that evening, and Marjorie recognized
that something was concerning
me, but she asked no questions, and
I only told her about the success of
the kite, and the youngsters embarking
on a shopping trip for paper, glue
and wood splints. There was no use
in both of us worrying.</p>

<p>On Friday we all got down to work,
and presently had a regular production
line under way; stapling the
wood splints, then wetting them with
a resin solution and shaping them
over a mandrel to stiffen, cutting the
plastic film around a pattern, assembling
and hanging the finished kites
from an overhead beam until the cement
had set. Pete Cope had located
a big roll of red plastic film from
somewhere, and it made a wonderful-looking
kite. Happily, I didn't know
what the film cost until the first kites
were sold.</p>

<p>By Wednesday of the following
week we had almost three hundred
kites finished and packed into flat
cardboard boxes, and frankly I didn't
care if I never saw another. Tommy,
who by mutual consent, was our
authority on sales, didn't want to sell
any until we had, as he put it, enough
to meet the demand, but this quantity
seemed to satisfy him. He said he
would sell them the next week and
Mary McCready, with a fine burst of
confidence, asked him in all seriousness
to be sure to hold out a dozen.</p>

<p>Three other things occurred that
day, two of which I knew about immediately.
Mary brought a portable
typewriter from home and spent part
of the afternoon banging away at
what seemed to me, since I use two
fingers only, a very creditable speed.</p>

<p>And Hilary brought in a bottle of
his new detergent. It was a syrupy
yellow liquid with a nice collar of
suds. He'd been busy in his home
laboratory after all, it seemed.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked. "You never
told us."</p>

<p>Hilary grinned. "Lauryl benzyl
phosphonic acid, dipotassium salt, in
20% solution."</p>

<p>"Goodness." I protested, "it's been
twenty-five years since my last course
in chemistry. Perhaps if I saw the
formula&mdash;."</p>

<p>He gave me a singularly adult
smile and jotted down a scrawl of
symbols and lines. It meant little to
me.</p>

<p>"Is it good?"</p>

<p>For answer he seized the ice bucket,
now empty of its soda bottles,
trickled in a few drops from the bottle
and swished the contents. Foam
mounted to the rim and spilled over.
"And that's our best grade of Ridgeville
water," he pointed out. "Hardest
in the country."</p>

<p>The third event of Wednesday
came to my ears on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>I was a little late arriving at the
barn, and was taken a bit aback to
find the roadway leading to it rather
full of parked automobiles, and the
barn itself rather full of people, including
two policemen. Our Ridgeville
police are quite young men, but
in uniform they still look ominous
and I was relieved to see that they
were laughing and evidently enjoying
themselves.</p>

<p>"Well, now," I demanded, in my
best classroom voice. "What is all
this?"</p>

<p>"Are you Henderson?" the larger
policeman asked.</p>

<p>"I am indeed," I said, and a flash
bulb went off. A young lady grasped
my arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Mr. Henderson, come
outside where it's quieter and tell me
all about it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I countered, "somebody
should tell me."</p>

<p>"You mean you don't know, honestly?
Oh, it's fabulous. Best story I've
had for ages. It'll make the city papers."
She led me around the corner
of the barn to a spot of comparative
quiet.</p>

<p>"You didn't know that one of your
junior whatsisnames poured detergent
in the Memorial Fountain basin
last night?"</p>

<p>I shook my head numbly.</p>

<p>"It was priceless. Just before rush
hour. Suds built up in the basin and
overflowed, and down the library
steps and covered the whole street.
And the funniest part was they kept
right on coming. You couldn't imagine
so much suds coming from that
little pool of water. There was a
three-block traffic jam and Harry got
us some marvelous pictures&mdash;men
rolling up their trousers to wade
across the street. And this morning,"
she chortled, "somebody phoned in
an anonymous tip to the police&mdash;of
course it was the same boy that did
it&mdash;Tommy&mdash;Miller?&mdash;and so here
we are. And we just saw a demonstration
of that fabulous kite and saw
all those simply captivating mice."</p>

<p>"Mice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Who would ever
have thought you could breed mice
with those cute furry tails?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, after a while things quieted
down. They had to. The police left
after sobering up long enough to
give me a serious warning against
letting such a thing happen again.
Mr. Miller, who had come home to
see what all the excitement was, went
back to work and Mrs. Miller went
back to the house and the reporter
and photographer drifted off to file
their story, or whatever it is they do.
Tommy was jubilant.</p>

<p>"Did you hear what she said? It'll
make the city papers. I wish we had
a thousand kites. Ten thousand. Oh
boy, selling is fun. Hilary, when can
you make some more of that stuff?
And Doris, how many mice do you
have?"</p>

<p>Those mice! I have always kept
my enthusiasm for rodents within
bounds, but I must admit they were
charming little beasts, with tails as
bushy as miniature squirrels.</p>

<p>"How many generations?" I asked
Doris.</p>

<p>"Seventeen. No, eighteen, now.
Want to see the genetic charts?"</p>

<p>I won't try to explain it as she did
to me, but it was quite evident that
the new mice were breeding true.
Presently we asked Betty Miller to
come back down to the barn for a
conference. She listened and asked
questions. At last she said, "Well, all
right, if you promise me they can't
get out of their cages. But heaven
knows what you'll do when fall
comes. They won't live in an unheated
barn and you can't bring them
into the house."</p>

<p>"We'll be out of the mouse business
by then," Doris predicted. "Every pet
shop in the country will have
them and they'll be down to nothing
apiece."</p>

<p>Doris was right, of course, in spite
of our efforts to protect the market.
Anyhow that ushered in our cage
building phase, and for the next
week&mdash;with a few interruptions&mdash;we
built cages, hundreds of them, a good
many for breeding, but mostly for
shipping.</p>

<p>It was rather regrettable that, after
the <i>Courier</i> gave us most of the third
page, including photographs, we rarely
had a day without a few visitors.
Many of them wanted to buy mice or
kites, but Tommy refused to sell any
mice at retail and we soon had to disappoint
those who wanted kites. The
Supermarket took all we had&mdash;except
a dozen&mdash;and at a dollar fifty
each. Tommy's ideas of pricing rather
frightened me, but he set the value
of the mice at ten dollars a pair
and got it without any arguments.</p>

<p>Our beautiful stationery arrived,
and we had some invoice forms printed
up in a hurry&mdash;not engraved, for
a wonder.</p>

<p>It was on Tuesday&mdash;following the
Thursday&mdash;that a lanky young man
disentangled himself from his car
and strolled into the barn. I looked
up from the floor where I was tacking
squares of screening onto wooden
frames.</p>

<p>"Hi," he said. "You're Donald
Henderson, right? My name is McCord&mdash;Jeff
McCord&mdash;and I work in
the Patent Section at the Commission's
downtown office. My boss sent
me over here, but if he hadn't, I
think I'd have come anyway. What
are you doing to get patent protection
on Ridge Industries' new developments?"</p>

<p>I got my back unkinked and dusted
off my knees. "Well, now," I said,
"I've been wondering whether something
shouldn't be done, but I know
very little about such matters&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Exactly," he broke in, "we guessed
that might be the case, and there are
three patent men in our office who'd
like to chip in and contribute some
time. Partly for the kicks and partly
because we think you may have some
things worth protecting. How about
it? You worry about the filing and
final fees. That's sixty bucks per
brainstorm. We'll worry about everything
else."</p>

<p>"What's to lose," Tommy interjected.</p>

<p>And so we acquired a patent attorney,
several of them, in fact.</p>

<p>The day that our application on
the kite design went to Washington,
Mary wrote a dozen toy manufacturers
scattered from New York to Los
Angeles, sent a kite to each one and
offered to license the design. Result,
one licensee with a thousand dollar
advance against next season's royalties.</p>

<p class="cap">It was a rainy morning about three
weeks later that I arrived at the barn.
Jeff McCord was there, and the whole
team except Tommy. Jeff lowered his
feet from the picnic table and said,
"Hi."</p>

<p>"Hi yourself," I told him. "You
look pleased."</p>

<p>"I am," he replied, "in a cautious
legal sense, of course. Hilary and I
were just going over the situation on
his phosphonate detergent. I've spent
the last three nights studying the patent
literature and a few standard
texts touching on phosphonates.
There are a zillion patents on synthetic
detergents and a good round
fifty on phosphonates, but it looks"&mdash;he
held up a long admonitory hand&mdash;"it
just looks as though we had a clear
spot. If we do get protection, you've
got a real salable property."</p>

<p>"That's fine, Mr. McCord," Hilary
said, "but it's not very important."</p>

<p>"No?" Jeff tilted an inquiring eyebrow
at me, and I handed him a small
bottle. He opened and sniffed at it
gingerly. "What gives?"</p>

<p>"Before-shave lotion," Hilary told
him. "You've shaved this morning,
but try some anyway."</p>

<p>Jeff looked momentarily dubious,
then puddled some in his palm and
moistened his jaw line. "Smells
good," he noted, "and feels nice and
cool. Now what?"</p>

<p>"Wipe your face." Jeff located a
handkerchief and wiped, looked at
the cloth, wiped again, and stared.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"A whisker stiffener. It makes each
hair brittle enough to break off right
at the surface of your skin."</p>

<p>"So I perceive. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just a mixture of stuff. Cookbook
chemistry. Cysteine thiolactone
and a fat-soluble magnesium compound."</p>

<p>"I see. Just a mixture of stuff. And
do your whiskers grow back the next
day?"</p>

<p>"Right on schedule," I said.</p>

<p>McCord unfolded his length and
stood staring out into the rain. Presently
he said, "Henderson, Hilary
and I are heading for my office. We
can work there better than here, and
if we're going to break the hearts of
the razor industry, there's no better
time to start than now."</p>

<p>When they had driven off I turned
and said, "Let's talk a while. We can
always clean mouse cages later.
Where's Tommy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he stopped at the bank to get
a loan."</p>

<p>"What on earth for? We have over
six thousand in the account."</p>

<p>"Well," Peter said, looking a little
embarrassed, "we were planning to
buy a hydraulic press. You see, Doris
put some embroidery on that scheme
of mine for making ball bearings."
He grabbed a sheet of paper. "Look,
we make a roller bearing, this shape
only it's a permanent magnet. Then
you see&mdash;." And he was off.</p>

<p>"What did they do today, dear?"
Marge asked as she refilled my coffee
cup.</p>

<p>"Thanks," I said. "Let's see, it was
a big day. We picked out a hydraulic
press, Doris read us the first chapter
of the book she's starting, and we
found a place over a garage on
Fourth Street that we can rent for
winter quarters. Oh, yes, and Jeff is
starting action to get the company
incorporated."</p>

<p>"Winter quarters," Marge repeated.
"You mean you're going to try to
keep the group going after school
starts?"</p>

<p>"Why not? The kids can sail
through their courses without thinking
about them, and actually they
won't put in more than a few hours
a week during the school year."</p>

<p>"Even so, it's child labor, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Child labor nothing. They're the
employers. Jeff McCord and I will
be the only employees&mdash;just at first,
anyway."</p>

<p>Marge choked on something. "Did
you say you'd be an employee?"</p>

<p>"Sure," I told her. "They've offered
me a small share of the company,
and I'd be crazy to turn it down. After
all, what's to lose?"</p>
